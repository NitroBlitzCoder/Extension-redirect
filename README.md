# Use Cases
This code enables a chrome extension that has multiple different links to websites so that you can fast travel without needing to search them up. It includes three tabs: watching, shopping, and working. 
In each of these tabs there are logos to the websites by clicking on them, you can go to the website directly.
# Code explanation
This project uses 4 files: JSON, HTML, CSS, and finally JS.
The manifest contains the images for the extension, with each number representing the places where it will be displayed.
Next, the HTML contains the basic layout with the links to each one as well as the different tabs, where at the bottom we reference the JS file.
The CSS file contains the tab colors as well as a slight animation where the logo enlarges when you hover over it.
Finally, the JS file contains the interactables, checks the IDs when something is clicked, and displays those objects.
